     <h1 id="unique">About paris</h1>
     <p id="union">Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two
    international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe)
     and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris MÃ©tro, 
    serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe 
    after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and
     the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris has one of the most 
     sustainable transportation systems[15] and is one of the only two cities in the world that received 
     the Sustainable Transport Award twice.
