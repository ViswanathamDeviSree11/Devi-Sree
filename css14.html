    <h1>About chocolate</h1>
    <p>The cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec 
        peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as
         a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate
          to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries
           with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact,
            the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (“cacao”) inscribed on those containers
             was key to deciphering the Maya’s phonetic manner of writing.
