    Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. 
    There is evidence of the use of sacred ground as far back as 
    the Bronze Age and later during the Indus Valley civilization.
     Outside of the Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh and Nepal),
      Hindu temples have been built in various countries around the world.
